#### Hey, I’m Ethan Jones — a hands-on builder who’s been diving deep into the cloud world and loving every bit of it. I’m all about figuring things out, breaking them down, and putting them back together better. My journey into cloud engineering has been fueled by curiosity and persistence — learning tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and AWS, and making them all work together through real, messy, hands-on projects.
I’m AWS certified (CCP + SAA), big on observability with Grafana and Prometheus, and constantly building new ways to automate and scale systems. Check out my Portfolio — it’s basically a logbook of everything I’ve learned, built, and broken (then fixed) along the way.
