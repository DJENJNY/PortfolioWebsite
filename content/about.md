#### My name is Ethan Jones, a resilient, persistent, and tenacious individual who's on a journey to become a proficient Cloud Engineer. I’ve built a strong foundation by working with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Linux, EKS, and GitHub, while implementing observability and logging through Grafana and Prometheus. I’m also proficient in AWS and hold two certifications (CCP, SAA). My portfolio on GitHub showcases in-depth projects that demonstrate my hands-on experience and commitment to mastering this craft.
