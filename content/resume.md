## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Cloud Engineer Apprentice (1:1) | Tech For The Culture Mentorship (1/2025 - Present)

- Built and operated AWS environments with Terraform (VPC, IAM, EC2/EKS, ALB, autoscaling); created reusable modules and idempotent plans, reducing infra deploy time from ~45 min to ~8 min (≈−82%) across dev/stage/prod.
- Containerized applications with Docker for production and Docker Compose for local multi-service stacks; designed images for security/perf (multi-stage builds, minimal bases, SBOM/scanning).
- Stood up Kubernetes from scratch and on EKS; deployed via Helm/manifests; configured Ingress/ALB, health checks (readiness/liveness), rolling updates, and HPA.
- Implemented CI/CD (GitHub Actions) to build/test images, run terraform plan/apply, and deploy to Kubernetes; added policy checks and required approvals.
- Linux troubleshooting (networking, permissions, services, logs); standardized procedures to reduce MTTR and improve repeatability.
- Added monitoring & logging (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki) with alerts for latency, errors, and resource saturation.
- Followed security best practices: least-privilege IAM/IRSA, security groups, secrets management, image & IaC scanning, and drift detection.
- Documented architectures, READMEs, runbooks and operational procedures.
