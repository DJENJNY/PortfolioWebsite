## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Cloud Engineer | TFTC (1:1) ~600+ hours (≈20 hrs/week) (1/2025 - Present)

- Built and operated AWS environments with Terraform (VPC, IAM, EC2/EKS, ALB, autoscaling); created reusable modules and idempotent plans, reducing infra deploy time from ~45 min to ~8 min (≈−82%) across dev/stage/prod
- Containerized 10+ applications with Docker and Docker Compose for multi-service local stacks; designed optimized multi-stage images that reduced image size by 40% and improved build time by 30% through caching and security scanning (SBOMs)
- Deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters (both self-managed and AWS EKS) supporting 20+ microservices; implemented Helm-based deployments with ALB Ingress, health probes, rolling updates, and autoscaling (HPA) to sustain 99.9% uptime under variable workloads.
- Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate testing, image builds, Terraform plan/apply, and Kubernetes deployments—cutting manual deployment time from 30 minutes to under 5 minutes and enforcing compliance via policy checks and required approvals.
- Streamlined Linux troubleshooting workflows (networking, permissions, service management, log analysis), developing standardized runbooks that lowered mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by 50%.
- Implemented full-stack observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, instrumenting key metrics and alerts for latency, error rates, and resource saturation; enabled proactive remediation that reduced incident frequency by 25%.
- Strengthened infrastructure security through least-privilege IAM/IRSA, network ACLs, secrets encryption, IaC/image scanning, and drift detection—maintaining zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- Authored 15+ pages of documentation, including system architectures, READMEs, and runbooks, improving onboarding efficiency and operational consistency across environments.

### Silver Lining SysOps (System Operations) Fellowship Program | Amazon Web Services | Remote (02/2024 - 08/2024)

- Completed 120+ hours of hands-on cloud engineering training under AWS field architects, certification instructors, and enterprise mentors, focusing on production-grade deployment and operations in AWS environments.
- Built and managed 15+ lab environments covering core AWS services including EC2, S3, RDS, EBS, Lambda, and CloudFormation—gaining practical experience with provisioning, configuration, and troubleshooting.
- Deployed 3-tier web applications using CloudFormation templates integrating front-end, back-end, and database layers; implemented cost monitoring and tagging strategies that reduced monthly test-environment costs by 30%.
- Collaborated with an AWS mentor to simulate enterprise-scale SysOps tasks (backup automation, IAM security hardening, system patching, and scaling) and achieved consistent 99% lab reliability through proactive monitoring.
- Enhanced operational efficiency by writing reusable scripts and documenting setup procedures, cutting environment setup time from 45 minutes to under 10 minutes per lab.
- Recognized for technical excellence within the fellowship cohort for mastery of AWS best practices and demonstrable readiness for real-world SysOps and DevOps roles.
